# JavaScript phone apps  

XMMonitorDSL is our number one phone app for most phones:
- saves images to phone local storage as well as an online server
- can save images locally if an online server is not available
- runs only when the phone is horizontal
- runs 42 hours on our testing with a Vodafone E8 phone and a 20000 mAh powerpack.
  
    
XMMonitorDSH is an experimental alternative built with HTML, hence the H at the end of the name.
- runs when the phone is horizontal or vertical
- has a greater range of adjustments for image size and quality
- runs 30 hours on our testing with a Vodafone E8 phone and a 20000 mAh powerpack.
   
  
    
# HOWTO load JavaScript files into the Droidscript Environment

Droidscript apps are plain text JavaScript files.  
An app is defined by a DroidScript sub-folder with the startup program being a JavaScript file with a filename based on the sub-folder name. e.g. folder "XMMonitorDSL" containing file "XMMonitorDSL.js".  

Install DroidScript from the Google Play Store. The base DroidScript is a free app and is capable of running these programs.  

USB CABLE CONNECTION  
Connect the Android Device to a computer with a USB cable. You should be able to see the files and folders in the phone.  
Locate folder "DroidScript". Copy/Paste folders "XMMonitorDSL" and "XMMonitorDSH" from the computer to under "Droidscript".  

WIFI Copy/Paste Text  
Follow instructions from Droidscript to edit JavaScript from your computer by remote wi-fi connection. 
Create App "XMMonitorDSL" as a new JavaScript app. Copy and paste the code from file "XMMonitorDSL.js" 
on your computer into "XMMonitorDSL.js" in Droidscript. Save and run.    
  
XMMonitorDSH is more experimental. If you want to run it:  
Create App "XMMonitorDSH" as a new HTML app.  
Copy and paste the code from file "XMMonitorDSH.html" on your computer into "XMMonitorDSH.html" in Droidscript.
Then create a new JavaScript file "diff-cam-engine-xjpc.js" in Droidscript and copy-paste across from the file 
of the same name on your computer.
